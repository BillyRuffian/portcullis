```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'parliament_members'

api_instance = ParliamentMembers::LocationApi.new
location_type = ParliamentMembers::LocationType::N0 # LocationType | Location by type of location
location_name = 'location_name_example' # String | Location by name specified

  #Returns a list of locations, both parent and child
  result = api_instance.api_location_browse_location_type_location_name_get(location_type, location_name)
